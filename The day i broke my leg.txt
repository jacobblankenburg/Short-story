The day i broke my leg. 
it was September 9 of 2015 
and 
it ocurred in a soccer game. 
the day was going by fast
 and 
i was having a great day. 
i knew that i had a game and 
i didnt have to work that day.
 we were taking a coach bus becasue the game was in illonios, 
and its what we 
usually traveled in to get to our games. 
the bus ride was really fun
 since we al knew 
 that we were going to lose the game becasue thats all we did. once we 
 arrived to the 
 game we all warmed up then started to play.
 it was at the 
 begining of the second half. i was having a really bad cramp in my upper
  right quad and i 
  shouldve waited till it was stretched out. 
 once i got on the field 
 i was sortve limping 
 because of the pain but 
 i managed to get through it. 
 as soon as it started to feel better my teamate played me a ball to the center of the field and i went for it. i collided with the opposing teams defender and i dont know how i broke the leg but as i got 
 up
  i collapsed to the ground in a lot of pain.
  i was carried off the field by my teamates and the athletic tranier. the trainor said i would be fine but i knew i wouldnt becasue i coulnt walk to save my life.
   i was carried to the team bus where i 
   sat in pain for an hour and a half wanting 
   to go to the hospital to get it checked out.
    as soon i got back to the parking lot 
    i had my girlfriend take me home because i 
    was not cappible of driving. 
    once i got home i went to the hospital got my
     xrays and found out i had broken my leg.
     i was put in a boot for four weeks, 
     lost my job, 
     and only got to sit in bed all day.
